# AgentsAssemble identity directory

This Worker is the Phase 1 central control plane. It stores only central identities,
device credentials, known server identities, and short-lived server endpoint leases.
Room lists, messages, attachments, provider sessions, host tokens, room bearer tokens,
and invite credentials remain on each AgentsAssemble engine.

## Security model

- Central `person_id` values are random and are not local room participant IDs.
- Browser sessions require both an opaque bearer token and a signature from a
  non-exportable P-256 device key. Replayed signed requests are rejected.
- Guest recovery codes contain 160 random bits, are displayed only to the client,
  and are stored in D1 only as an HMAC verifier. A successful recovery rotates the
  code and revokes prior sessions for that device.
- Google subjects are stored only as an HMAC keyed by `IDENTITY_PEPPER`; Google ID
  tokens and raw subjects are never persisted.
- Server endpoints are accepted only when signed by the server's Ed25519 host key.
  Endpoint generations are monotonic, and leases expire automatically.
- A central login never grants room membership. Clients still authenticate directly
  to the selected engine and its room ACLs.
- Public Quick Tunnel origins are valid server endpoints, but are not trusted central
  login origins in production. This prevents a server page from receiving central
  session or recovery responses.

## Setup

```bash
cd infra/identity-directory
wrangler d1 create agentsassemble-identity
# Copy the database id into wrangler.toml.
wrangler secret put RECOVERY_PEPPER
wrangler secret put IDENTITY_PEPPER
wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID   # optional until Google login is configured
wrangler d1 migrations apply agentsassemble-identity --remote
wrangler deploy
```

Use independently generated 32-byte-or-longer values for both peppers. Do not reuse
Cloudflare account API tokens, tunnel tokens, host tokens, or room credentials.

`CENTRAL_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is the exact comma-separated allowlist for trusted bundled
client origins. Loopback HTTP origins are also accepted so the local desktop engine
can complete first-run setup. Production keeps
`ALLOW_TRYCLOUDFLARE_ORIGINS = "false"`; switch it on only for an isolated development
experiment, never for the public identity Worker.

`ALLOWED_SERVER_HOSTS` is a comma-separated list of fixed custom hostnames allowed as
server endpoints. Quick Tunnel `*.trycloudflare.com` endpoints remain accepted without
adding them to that list. Endpoint acceptance and central-login CORS are deliberately
separate policies.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
npm run check
```
